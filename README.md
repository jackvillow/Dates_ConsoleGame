Just Console Game "Dates" ðŸ“…

The first player reports some date in January. Each player on their turn calls a later date, increasing either the calendar date in the month or the month, but not both at once. If, for example, the start date was January 8, then you can go to March 8 or January 12. You can zoom in less: January 9 or February 8; you can go straight to December 8 or January 31. Note: if you go to January 31, then your opponent will be able to change only the months in the future, and moreover only the months with 31 days.

The first person to reach December 31 wins
